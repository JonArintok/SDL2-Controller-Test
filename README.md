# SDL2-Controller-Test

This is a simple command line program that displays which controller buttons are being pressed, along with analog values and angles.

Here's some example output which shows the left trigger half-pressed, the d-pad up button pressed, and the left analog stick tilted left:
```
  0.50              0.00
   +                 +
   #      + + +      +
 +   +             +   +
   +                 +
 -1.00  +       +   0.00
 -0.00              0.00
LS angle:-0.500   RS angle: 0.000
LS mgntd: 1.000   RS mgntd: 0.000

```
"mgntd" stands for "magnitude"(how far the stick is from center).
